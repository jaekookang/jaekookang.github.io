Hi, I’m Jaekoo Kang, a researcher and developer specializing in human speech production. Speaking is a fundamental aspect of human communication, where articulators like the tongue and lips shape sounds that are transmitted to the ear and ultimately interpreted by the brain. What fascinates me most is how the continuous movement of articulators is perceived as discrete concepts in our minds—a phenomenon often described as “discrete infinity.”<sup>1)</sup> This captivating process has fueled my passion for research, and I remain deeply intrigued by the complexities of speech production and its limitless possibilities, especially when combined with computational modeling and AI.
