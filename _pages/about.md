ABOUT ME
===

<br />

Hi, I'm Jaekoo. I'm a researcher and a developer in the domain of human speech production. Speaking is one of the primary function in human communication. Articulators such as the tongue ðŸ‘… and lips ðŸ‘„ shape the output sound, which is ultimately delivered to the ear to the brain. Particularly, the continuous movement of articulators are decoded as a discrete concept in our mind. Isn't this super fascinating? This has motivated me to pursue my research interests and still I feel very much interested this "discrete infinity"<sup>1)</sup> in speech.
