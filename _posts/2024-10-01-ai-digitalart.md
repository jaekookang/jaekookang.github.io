The recent advance in AI and LLMs also had a tremendous impact on the education sector. For example, AI-based courseware and products are already available in the market focusing on helping children solve math problems, learning writing, lanugage learning, and so on. However, it has been somewhat still limited in terms of AI-based application in art, especially digital art education.

When I worked in i-Scream arts where making digital art education platform ("Art Bonbon") and providing coaching online as a director of AI research, I had the opportunity to combine AI technologies with the digital art education. I made contribution to the development of three AI-based services for digital art education, which include:

# 1. AI-based Progress Report ("AI Report")
* Aim: Generate an automatic analysis report for children's art-learning progress to parents.
* Description: a weekly or monthly report based on children's learning data (audio/drawing/metadata) using GPT.
* Outcome: Included in the digital art education platform as a service since 2023.

# 2. AI-based Drawing Diagnostic Tests
* Aim: Build a system for an automatic diagnostic drawing test for psychological assessment (digital art therapy) 
* Description: Two drawing diagnostic tests were developed using custom AI models and MLLMs, measuring the amount of stress, coping strategy and emotionality in children.
* Outcome: Drawing tests have been developed and beta-tested successfully and will be launched at selected schools in Korea in 2024.

# 3. AI-based Sketch Tool ("AI Sketch")
* Aim: Help children in the initial process of drawing a sketch using AI
* Description: 'AI Sketch' function was included on Art Bonbon's platform (drawing tool) such that when children take or upload a photo, AI model extracts sketches for them.
* Outcome: Two main functions were developed (photo-based AI Sketch & generative image-based AI Sketch using Stable Diffusion)
